<p>Now that software shapes every day of our lives, we must make doubly sure it's working for us, and not for them.  In particular, we need <b>top level interfaces</b> (home screens, notification centers, app stores, newsfeeds, and browsers) <b>that prioritize what we, the users, truly want out of life</b>.  We must no longer tolerate interfaces designed to maximize what's important for software and media companies&mdash;for instance, time spent scrolling, app downloads, or ad revenue&mdash;at the expense of our daily lives. But what would a notification screen organized by what's important to us look like? And if different things are truly important for different people, how can software come to support every kind of user?

<p><b>Will &amp; Intent</b> will be an affiliation of designers, philosophers, economists, and OS researchers who believe in solving these problems. We want to show users how much better it is when technology doesn't have its own agenda.  If we can communicate the appeal, we believe <a href="https://medium.com/@edelwax/mobile-platforms-and-human-values-74e5380713eb">the industry will race</a> to provide an OS that's good for people, and software that's just good for "engagement" or sales will be a thing of the past.
