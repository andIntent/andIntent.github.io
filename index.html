We are a loose affiliation of designers, philosophers, economists, and operating systems researchers with an ambitious vision: <i>Operating systems that understand and prioritize the <a href="https://medium.com/@edelwax/mobile-platforms-and-human-values-74e5380713eb">individual values of each user</a>, rather than the values of software companies, media companies, or app entrepreneurs.</i>

<p>We create demos and small projects to light the way for industry and for policymakers, and to excite users.  We're starting with redesigns for <i>top level interfaces</i>&mdash;home screens, notification centers, app stores, and browsers&mdash;and with data models to enable these redesigns.

<h4>Projects</h4>

<ul>
  <li><b><a href="/cxp/">The Collective Experience Project</a></b> &mdash; a database of the values behind and the outcomes of user engagements with various URLs, includes <a href="/cxp/#values">a taxonomy of valueable things</a>, which accounts for what people find important as they browse the web, use apps, and schedule thier lives, and a chrome extension called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hindsight/accbpganjjaadepnncaknjdkogbmgfbl">Hindsight</a> &mdash; which matches your web use to your underlying values and goals</li>
  <li><B><a href="https://twitter.com/doubtclubsf">Doubt Club SF</a></B> &mdash; a well-structured monthly event for leaders in the SF tech scene to start thinking philosophically about their impact and about media impact in general</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://nxhx.org/Choicemaking/">Human Interface Guidelines for Expressive, Social, and Informed Choices</a></b> &mdash; a new HIG for a new world; in-depth exploration of design patterns for allowing users to use their device to choose according to their own values</li>
