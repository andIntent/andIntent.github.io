We are a loose affiliation of designers, philosophers, economists, and operating systems researchers with an ambitious vision: <i>Operating systems that understand and prioritize the <a href="https://medium.com/@edelwax/mobile-platforms-and-human-values-74e5380713eb">individual values of each user</a>, rather than the values of software companies, media companies, or app entrepreneurs.</i>

<p>We create demos and small projects to light the way for industry and for policymakers, and to excite users.  We're starting with redesigns for <i>top level interfaces</i>&mdash;home screens, notification centers, app stores, and browsers&mdash;and with data models to enable these redesigns.

<h4>Projects</h4>
