<p>Now that software shapes every day of our lives, we must make doubly sure it's working for us, and not for them.  In particular, we need <i>top level interfaces</i>&mdash;home screens, notification centers, app stores, newsfeeds, and browsers&mdash; that prioritize what we, the users, truly want out of life.  We can no longer tolerate interfaces that maximize what's important for software and media companies--for instance, time spent scrolling, app downloads, or ad revenue--at the expense of our daily lives. But what would user-aligned interfaces look like, and how would we discover what's truly important for each user, so as to make them?

<p><b>Will &amp; Intent</b> will be an affiliation of designers, philosophers, economists, and OS researchers who believe in solving these problems. We will give the public a taste of how it feels to use technology they don't have to fight with.  Once the difference is recognized as a competitive advantage, we believe <a href="https://medium.com/@edelwax/mobile-platforms-and-human-values-74e5380713eb">the industry will race</a> to provide an OS that's good for people, not just good for eyeballs or sales.
