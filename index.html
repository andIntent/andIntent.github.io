<p>Software is no longer just for making or learning, now. Software is for living. Software is full-time. 

<p>We need OSes that are organized by what we, the users, truly want out of life, rather than what software and media companies can get out of us.

<p>Will + Intent is a loose affiliation of designers, philosophers, economists, and operating systems researchers who believe this is possible, and that once the public has a taste of it, <a href="https://medium.com/@edelwax/mobile-platforms-and-human-values-74e5380713eb">the industry will be forced</a> to provide an OS that's good for people, not just good for eyeballs. 

<p>We're focused on delivering those tastes.  We are in the business of software tastings. A new kind of advocacy. 

<p>We're starting with redesigns for <i>top level interfaces</i>&mdash;home screens, notification centers, app stores, and browsers&mdash;and with data collection efforts that focus on what's important to people, rather than what they can be tricked into buying or downloading.
