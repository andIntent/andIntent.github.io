<p>Now that software is with us every day of our lives, we need to make doubly sure it's working for us, and not for them.  In particular, we need <i>top level interfaces</i>&mdash;home screens, notification centers, app stores, newsfeeds, and browsers&mdash; that prioritize what we, the users, truly want out of life.  We can no longer tolerate interfaces that maximize what's important for software and media companies--for instance, engagement and ad revenue--at the expense of our daily lives. But what would user-aligned interfaces look like, and how would we know what's important to each user in the first place?

<p><b>Will &amp; Intent</b> is a loose affiliation of designers, philosophers, economists, and OS researchers who believe in solving these problems and in giving the public a taste of what technology they don't have to fight with would be like.  Once the public has a taste of it, <a href="https://medium.com/@edelwax/mobile-platforms-and-human-values-74e5380713eb">the industry will be forced</a> to provide an OS that's good for people, not just good for eyeballs or sales.
