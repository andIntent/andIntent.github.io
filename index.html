<p><i>The devices on our wrists and in our pockets must work for us, not for software and media companies.  They must be designed, therefore, to help us live according to our own values, not to lead us towards things that they want to maximize, like time spent scrolling, app downloads, or ad revenue.</i>  <a href="https://medium.com/@edelwax/mobile-platforms-and-human-values-74e5380713eb">Read our manifesto.</a></p>

<p><b>Will &amp; Intent</b> is a small organization that faciliates discussion and discernment around the values behind the design of our notification centers, our app stores, etc. We'll fund projects that: </p>

<ul>
<li><b>Collect and publish open data about software use and alignment with end-user values.</b>  (see, <b><a href="/cxp/">the Collective Experience Project</a></b> and a chrome extension called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hindsight/accbpganjjaadepnncaknjdkogbmgfbl">Hindsight</a>)</li>
<li><b>Increase articulacy about value-alignment amongst designers.</b>  (see <b><a href="http://nxhx.org/Choicemaking/">Human Values, Choicemaking, and Interface Design</a></b>, a design patterns handbook)</li>
<li><b>Increase articulacy about value-alignment amongst the internet leadership.</b>  (see <b><a href="https://twitter.com/doubtclubsf">Doubt Club SF</a></B> &mdash; a monthly event for leaders in SF tech to think philosophically)</li>
<li><b>Create demos and communities that advance the cause of a nonmanipulative internet.</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Now that software shapes every day of our lives, we must make doubly sure it's working for us, and not for them.  In particular, we need <b>top level interfaces</b> (home screens, notification centers, app stores, newsfeeds, and browsers) <b>that </b>. But what would a notification screen organized by what's important to us look like? And if different things are truly important for different people, how can software come to support every kind of user?

 be an affiliation of designers, philosophers, economists, and OS researchers who believe in solving these problems. We want to show users how much better it is when technology doesn't have its own agenda.  If we can communicate the appeal, we believe <a href="">the industry will race</a> to provide an OS that's good for people, and software that's just good for "engagement" or sales will be a thing of the past.
